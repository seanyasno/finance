## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration Score:** 15/15 exports properly wired
**Orphaned Exports:** 0
**Broken Links:** 0

### Phase 6 → Phase 7 Integration: ✅ CONNECTED

**Connection:** Search results are grouped by date correctly

- Search state preserved in `debouncedSearchText`
- Grouping operates on `transactionService.transactions` (which contains search results)
- Verified at TransactionListView.swift lines 163-170

### Phase 7 → Phase 8 Integration: ✅ CONNECTED

**Connection:** Date grouping infrastructure extended to card and month modes

- Date mode uses `dateGroupingKey` and `sectionHeaderTitle` from Phase 7
- Card mode uses `cardGroupingKey` and `cardSectionHeader` from Phase 8
- Month mode uses `monthGroupingKey` and `monthSectionHeader` from Phase 8
- Verified at TransactionListView.swift lines 166-181 (exhaustive switch)

### Phase 8 → Phase 9 Integration: ✅ CONNECTED

**Connection:** Conditional card display works correctly with grouping modes

- `showCard: groupingMode != .creditCard` passes grouping context to TransactionRowView
- TransactionRowView conditionally renders CardLabel based on showCard parameter
- Eliminates redundant card information when grouped by card
- Verified at TransactionListView.swift line 75 and TransactionRowView.swift lines 12, 32

### Phase 9 Visual Consistency: ✅ CONNECTED

**Connection:** Visual formatting applies uniformly across all contexts

**CardLabel Component:**
- Used in TransactionRowView (list view)
- Used in TransactionDetailView (detail view)
- Consistent "CardName 1234" format with monospaced digits

**Pending Indicators:**
- Visible in TransactionRowView (list view, lines 42-46)
- Visible in TransactionDetailView (detail view, lines 46-52)
- Consistent clock.fill icon in orange across both views

---

## End-to-End User Flows

**Flow Score:** 4/4 flows complete
**Broken Flows:** 0

### Flow 1: Search with Grouping Modes — ✅ COMPLETE

**User Journey:**
1. User types search query → Debounced after 300ms
2. API called with search parameter → OR query filters results
3. Results displayed → Stored in transactionService.transactions
4. Grouped by current mode → groupedTransactions computed property
5. Card display conditional applied → showCard parameter based on groupingMode
6. Pending indicators shown → clock icon rendered if isPending

**Verification:** All 6 steps connected without breaks

### Flow 2: Grouping Mode Switch — ✅ COMPLETE

**User Journey:**
1. User has active search (e.g., "amazon")
2. User switches grouping mode via menu
3. @AppStorage writes to UserDefaults
4. groupingMode computed property updates
5. groupedTransactions recomputes with new mode
6. Search results remain unchanged (no re-fetch)
7. UI regrouped with same data automatically

**Critical Finding:** Grouping mode changes are purely client-side. Search state preserved because no API re-fetch occurs.

**Verification:** All 7 steps connected without breaks

### Flow 3: Filter + Search + Grouping — ✅ COMPLETE

**User Journey:**
1. User applies date filter → applyFilters() called
2. Filter includes search term → passed to fetchTransactions
3. API called with both filters and search → all parameters sent
4. Results displayed → transactionService.transactions updated
5. Grouped by current mode → groupedTransactions recomputes
6. Pull-to-refresh preserves all state → loadData() includes search

**Verification:** All 6 steps connected without breaks

### Flow 4: Transaction View with Visual Formatting — ✅ COMPLETE

**User Journey:**
1. Transaction list displays with grouping → Sections with headers
2. Row shows conditional card → CardLabel only if showCard=true
3. Row shows pending indicator → Clock icon if isPending
4. User taps transaction → NavigationLink to detail view
5. Detail view shows CardLabel → Consistent format
6. Detail view shows status → Pending indicator with same format

**Verification:** All 6 steps connected without breaks

5. UI debounces search (TransactionListView.swift lines 91-98)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Data Flow Verification

### Search State Management

```
searchText (line 16)
  → onChange debounce (lines 91-98)
  → debouncedSearchText (line 17)
  → loadData/applyFilters/performSearch (lines 195, 205, 215)
  → TransactionService.fetchTransactions (search parameter)
  → API call with search query
  → Results in transactionService.transactions
  → Displayed via groupedTransactions
```

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Grouping Mode Persistence

```
User selection (line 105)
  → groupingModeRaw = mode.rawValue
  → @AppStorage writes to UserDefaults (line 19)
  → groupingMode computed property (lines 21-23)
  → groupedTransactions switch (line 166)
  → UI re-renders with new grouping
  → App restart loads from UserDefaults
```

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Visual Formatting Cascade

```
GroupingMode selection
  → showCard = groupingMode != .creditCard (line 75)
  → TransactionRowView(showCard:) (line 74)
  → if showCard, let card = ... CardLabel(card:) (lines 32-34)
  → CardLabel uses card.company.rawValue + last4Digits (CardLabel.swift lines 30-31)
  → Monospaced formatting applied (line 18)
```

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Code Quality

### Anti-Patterns: NONE FOUND

**Verified Clean:**
- ✅ No TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments
- ✅ No stub implementations
- ✅ No empty returns or console-only handlers
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Type-safe implementations
- ✅ No hardcoded values where dynamic expected
- ✅ SQL injection safe (parameterized queries)
- ✅ User-scoped queries (security)

### Established Patterns

**1. Debounced Search:**
- Task-based with cancellation (TransactionListView.swift lines 91-98)
- Prevents API spam during typing
- Clean state management with searchTask property

**2. Grouping Strategy:**
- Switch-based with exhaustive enum cases
- Dictionary(grouping:) native Swift O(n) operation
- Computed property triggers automatic re-render

**3. Conditional Rendering:**
- Parameter-based (showCard pattern)
- Backward compatible with default values
- Eliminates redundant information display

**4. Cached Formatters:**
- Static let in DateFormatting enum
- Prevents repeated formatter creation during scroll
- Performance optimization for list views

**5. Component Reusability:**
- CardLabel component with convenience initializers
- Single source of truth for card display format
- Consistent across list and detail views

---

## Performance Considerations

**Efficient Implementations:**
- ✅ Dictionary(grouping:) is native Swift O(n) operation
- ✅ Cached date formatters prevent repeated formatter creation
- ✅ Computed properties only recalculate on dependency changes
- ✅ Client-side grouping avoids unnecessary API round-trips
- ✅ Debounced search reduces API calls during typing

**No Performance Issues Detected**
